Hi, I'm Kevin - a systems engineer rooted in Brooklyn, NY. Building and scaling robust distributed systems spanning ML, OLTP, and OLAP workloads is where I'm most in my element.
Squeezing out maximum PERF per $ using every weapon in the arsenal is what I live for.

Immensely grateful to have previously been at <span style="color: #e60000;">[Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/)</span>, <span style="color: #e60000;">[Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/)</span>, and <span style="color: #e60000;">[Tulip Interfaces](https://www.tulip.co/)</span> early in my career.
